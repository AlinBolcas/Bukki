# Bukki - Neural Book Writing System

Bukki is an innovative neural assistant designed to streamline the book creation process. Utilizing the power of AI, Bukki aids authors, researchers, and hobbyists in transforming initial concepts into complete manuscripts. From generating titles and outlines to conducting comprehensive research, Bukki simplifies each step, making book writing more accessible and efficient.

## Features

- **Automated Process**: Generate a book from start to finish with minimal input, ideal for getting started on a brief direction or theme.
- **Manual Control**: Dive deeper into each phase of the book creation process, choosing specific details and guiding the outcome.
- **Research Generation**: Focus on gathering detailed, comprehensive research tailored to your book's theme.
- **Customizable Pathways**: Whether you prefer a hands-off approach or want to be involved in every detail, Bukki has a path for you.
- **Category and Subcategory Selection**: Choose from a wide range of categories and subcategories to best match your book's topic.
- **Streamlit Web App**: An intuitive Streamlit app facilitates the entire process, providing a user-friendly interface for each step.
